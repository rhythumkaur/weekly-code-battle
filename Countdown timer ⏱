LOGIC IMPLEMENTED 
Firstly I had import time function so that we can use time functions.
Then I had used input function to take input from user that for how much 
seconds to need to countdown.
Then after that a for loop is being 
used to count backwards 
and then sleep function.
 And finally when countdown will be over a message will come "You were Deceived"







SOLUTION 

import time
#this will allow us to use time functions

seconds = int(input("How many seconds?"))
#asking the user for how many seconds we want to count down

#use a ranged loop to count downwards
for i in range(seconds):
  print(str(seconds - i )+ "seconds remain")
  
  time.sleep(1)
  #python sleep for 1 second between each iteration
  
  
print("You were Deceived")
